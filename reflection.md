# Project Reflection
## Easy and Hard
I found writing the backend in Assignment 4a to be straightforward since my project didn't rely on a lot of complex logic and the concept format made sense to me. I also didn't face many difficulties creating the frontend in Assignment 4b since I vibe coded most of it. The most difficult part of the project for me was implementing the syncs in Assignment 4c. I was out sick the lecture implementing syncs was covered, so I did have to figure out a lot of the common bugs on my own. This assignment also required me to change a lot of my frontend, which highlighted choices the agent made that weren't necessarily the best from what I could tell. It just overall took the most time and debugging.

## What Went Well
I think the project came together well overall, especially considering this is my first project of this magnitude and I have little experience in frontend and web applications. All of the features I wanted work and I'm happy with the end product.

## Mistakes
For future projects, I will definitely handle time management better, since juggling this and other major tests/projects in my other classes was challenging this time around. I think it would be halpful for me to break up assignments into smaller tasks next time I build an application.

I also think the way I first built the front and backends made them incompatable with the sync framework we had to use for this project, causing a lot of major refactors for this assignment. I think now that I'm familiar with the whole process though, my first implementations for any future projects will be formatted better.

## Acquired Skills
As I mentioned earlier, I had no frontend experience prior to this class, so I did gain some basic ability to use Vue and do web design. I would like to continue to develop these skills in the future.

## LLMs
### Context
I used Context to write test suites for my backend and debug my concept implementations if I ran into a bug I couldn't figure out.
### Cursor
For my frontened, I used the Cursor Agent Tool to vibe code.
### LLMs in SWE
Overall, I think the LLMs worked fine, but looking back, I also now think it's not really a good idea to use LLMs to implement things you don't already know how to implement yourself. I had Cursor create most of my frontend, and because I wasn't super familiar with how it worked, it made it more difficult to adapt it to sync server.

I appreciated having Context to write test suites, however. Writing tests isn't difficult, but it can be tedious, so it was really nice to have them generated and I just need to look them over to make sure they test all the functionality
