# Concept implementation

Below is a concept specification and implementation for an Authentication concept

**Concept: Authenticate**

Purpose: authenticate users with passwords

Principle: A user registers with a username and password to create an account. They can then log in with their username and password to access their account

State:

```
a set of Users with
  a username String
  a password String
```

actions:

```
register (username: String, password: String):(user:User)
  requires: no User in the Users set has username
  effects: creates a User with username and password and adds it to Users set

deleteUser (user: User)
  effects: deletes user from Users set

changePassword (user: User, newPassword: String)
    effects: replaces password of user with newPassword

authenticate (username: String, password: String):(user:User)
    requires: User with username and password exists in the Users set
    effects: returns that user
```
