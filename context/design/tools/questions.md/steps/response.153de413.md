# response:

Okay, if you're still getting `JSR package not found: @hono/cors` after upgrading Deno and reloading the cache, it points to a more fundamental issue with Deno's ability to resolve or download JSR packages from the internet.

Let's try some deeper troubleshooting steps:

### 1. **Verify Your Deno Version (Again)**

Just to be absolutely sure, run:

```bash
deno -v
```

You should be on a relatively recent version (e.g., `1.37.x` or higher, ideally the latest stable). If it's an older version, the `deno upgrade` might not have worked as expected.

### 2. **Test JSR Connectivity with a Simple Package**

Let's see if Deno can fetch *any* JSR package, or if the problem is specific to `@hono/cors`.

Create a new, temporary Deno file (e.g., `test_jsr.ts`):

```typescript
// test_jsr.ts
import { blue } from "jsr:@std/fmt/colors"; // A very common JSR package

console.log(blue("If you see this in blue, JSR is working!"));
```

Then run it:

```bash
deno run test_jsr.ts
```

* **If it runs and prints in blue:** This means Deno can generally access JSR. The problem might be specific to `@hono/cors` or some cached state. Try `deno cache --reset` (which is more aggressive than `--reload`) and then re-run your server.
* **If it *fails* with a "JSR package not found" error:** This confirms Deno has a general problem fetching *any* JSR package. This is a stronger indicator of network, proxy, or Deno installation issues.

### 3. **Deep Dive into Network/Proxy Issues**

Since you're on Windows and seeing "JSR package not found", the most common culprits are:

* **Corporate Proxy / VPN:** Are you on a network that uses a proxy server or a VPN? If so, Deno needs to be configured to use it.
  * Set environment variables:
    ```cmd
    set HTTP_PROXY=http://your.proxy.server:port
    set HTTPS_PROXY=http://your.proxy.server:port
    ```
    (Replace with your actual proxy details). You might need to set these permanently or in your terminal session *before* running Deno.
  * **TLS/SSL Inspection:** Some corporate proxies intercept HTTPS traffic and re-sign certificates. Deno might not trust these certificates.
    * You might need to download your company's root CA certificate and tell Deno to use it:
      ```cmd
      set DENO_TLS_CA_STORE=C:\path\to\your\company_root_ca.pem
      ```
      This is an advanced step, and you'd need to get the CA file from your IT department.

* **Firewall:** Ensure your firewall (Windows Defender Firewall or a third-party one) isn't blocking Deno from making outbound connections to `jsr.io` (or any external servers).

### 4. **Check Deno's Debug Output**

Run your server with a debug log level to see more verbose output about what Deno is doing when it tries to resolve dependencies:

```bash
DENO_VERBOSE=1 deno run -A src/concept/_server.ts
# Or on Windows, try:
# $env:DENO_VERBOSE=1; deno run -A src/concept/_server.ts
```

Look for messages around `jsr:@hono/cors` that might indicate network errors, timeouts, or certificate issues.

### 5. **Reinstall Deno Completely**

If none of the above work, your Deno installation itself might be corrupted.

1. **Uninstall Deno:**
   * If you installed with `scoop`: `scoop uninstall deno`
   * If you installed manually: Delete the Deno executable (`deno.exe`) and the `DENO_INSTALL` directory (if you set one). Also remove any Deno-related paths from your system's `PATH` environment variable.
2. **Delete Deno's global cache:**
   * The cache location is usually `C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Local\deno` on Windows. Delete this entire folder.
3. **Reinstall Deno:**
   * The recommended way on Windows is using `scoop`:
     ```cmd
     scoop install deno
     ```
   * Alternatively, use the installer script (PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
     ```
   * Make sure Deno is added to your `PATH` correctly. Restart your terminal after reinstallation.

After reinstalling, try running your server again with a clean slate.

### What to provide if it's still failing:

If the issue persists, please provide:

1. The exact output of `deno -v`.
2. The output of running `deno run test_jsr.ts` (from step 2).
3. The full error log when running your main server script with `DENO_VERBOSE=1` (from step 4).
4. Information about your network environment (e.g., corporate network, VPN, home network).

This will help pinpoint whether it's a Deno version issue, a general JSR connectivity problem, or something specific to your network setup.
