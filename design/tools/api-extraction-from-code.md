# update
I've changed the name of the file and it's location. Are there any changes I need to make to the api spec? the new file name is below

[@Upvoting](../../src/concepts/UpvotingConcept.ts)

# response:

Based on the API Structure Rules provided:

1.  **Base URL:** Assumed to be `/api`.
2.  **Endpoint Naming:** `/{conceptName}/{actionOrQueryName}`. The `conceptName` is derived from the concept itself (`Upvoting`), not the file name. The `actionOrQueryName` comes from the method names.
3.  **HTTP Method, Data Format, Request/Response Body rules** are based on the action/query signatures and the concept's purpose/effects.

The change in the file name and its location (`src\concepts\UpvotingConcept.ts`) **does not affect the generated API specification**. The API specification is concerned with the *logical name of the concept* (`Upvoting`) and its *actions and queries*, not the physical file path of its implementation.

Therefore, **no changes are needed** to the API specification you previously generated.
