      a username String
      a password String

actions:

    register (username: String, password: String):(user:User)
      requires: no User in the Users set has username
      effects: creates a User with username and password and adds it to Users set

    deleteUser (user: User)
      effects: deletes user from Users set

    changePassword (user: User, newPassword: String)
        effects: replaces password of user with newPassword

    authenticate (username: String, password: String):(user:User)
        requires: User with username and password exists in the Users set
